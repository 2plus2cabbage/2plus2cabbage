#### Let's learn about cool topics in technology together.  We'll start out with Terraform and see how things evolve from there.
- I am not an expert, nor do I claim to be.
- The only thing I am an expert in is my own opinion - and sometimes that is flawed.
- I do stupid things.
- Sometimes I figure out they are stupid.
- Sometimes you will, please be kind.
